      <h1>Clones</h1>
      <p>Clones are genetically engineered beings produced by the Jinteki corporation to serve as slave labour (or "labour solutions" as the megacorporations would put it). Clones are custom-designed for particular roles and then mass-produced via cloning and rapid-growth technologies.</p>
      <p>Most of the clones produced by Jinteki are humanoid in form, though some (such as the space-adapted Turtlebacks) are not. All clones have distinctive barcodes tattooed on their necks to indicate their clone status, and that they are items possessed by their creators.</p>
      <p>Rumour has it that some clones are engineered for psionic abilities. Caprice Nisei is one such clone, along with the rest of the Nisei Mk II line.</p>
      <p>Clones share the highly profitable "labour solutions" market with bioroids produced by the Haas-Bioroid corporation. Clone labour is opposed by those of the group Humanity First. Under current American law, clones may not marry. They are also sterile, and cannot reproduce.</p>
